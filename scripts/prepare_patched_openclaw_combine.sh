# Patches openclaw-combine/openclaw_combine_api_server.py's
# `_maybe_submit_ready_samples()` -- the single dispatch point shared by ALL
# three submission branches (OPD+RL combined / OPD-only / RL-only, see the
# class docstring's truth table) -- to drop turns flagged by
# prepare_patched_openclaw_opd.sh's `is_aborted`/`generated_while_paused`
# markers before they reach ANY of the three branches.
#
# Why this file specifically (docs/issues_log.md 2026-08-13 entry): actual
# training imports `OpenClawCombineSelectAPIServer`, which subclasses
# `OpenClawCombineAPIServer` and overrides `_opd_evaluate()` but NOT
# `_maybe_submit_ready_samples()` -- that dispatch function lives entirely in
# this file (openclaw-combine/openclaw_combine_api_server.py), which
# previously had NO patch script at all. Patching only
# openclaw_opd_api_server.py or openclaw_combine_select_api_server.py (the
# two files that already had patch scripts) would have been silently
# invisible to real training -- the flags would be written into turn_data,
# but nothing would ever read them at the point that decides whether to
# submit to Megatron.
#
# Root cause being fixed: 408/503 timeouts on the Student <-> OpenClaw
# gateway link cause two categories of turns to still reach the training
# queue even though the environment that produced them was known-unreliable:
#   A. SGLang itself aborted the in-flight generation (pause_generation
#      cutting off a request mid-flight for a weight sync) -- finish_reason
#      == "abort", content is typically a truncated fragment.
#   B. The generation completed normally, but by the time its result was
#      written to turn_data, submission had already been paused for a
#      training step -- the environment that produced it was mid-pause,
#      even though nothing about the generation itself looks wrong.
# Confirmed via real run data (P11/P20: fr=abort turns submitted as OPD+RL
# with reward=+1.0; P17: 15 turns from a 408-retry-recovery window submitted
# as OPD+RL/RL with mixed +1/-1) that BOTH branches (_submit_turn_sample and
# _submit_rl_turn_sample) already receive this kind of polluted data --
# gating only the OPD hint-acceptance path (as an earlier draft of this fix
# considered) would leave the RL-only branch completely unprotected.
#
# Explicitly NOT covered by this patch (see docs/issues_log.md 2026-08-13):
# turns from the SAME session that are generated mid-run, DURING a 408/503
# recovery window, but complete normally (no abort, submission not paused at
# write time) -- these already get dispatched turn-by-turn in real time as
# the embedded agent run progresses, well before any end-of-run signal could
# arrive. This is the bulk of P17's pollution and is NOT solved here; it
# would require holding back dispatch for an entire embedded run pending an
# agent_end outcome, a materially bigger change to the submission pipeline
# that is deliberately out of scope for this patch. Do not describe this
# patch as "full coverage" of the 408/503 pollution problem.
#
# Official openclaw-combine/ directory is left untouched; this writes a
# patched copy to DEST_DIR, and the caller must prepend DEST_DIR to
# PYTHONPATH ahead of openclaw-combine/ so `import openclaw_combine_api_server`
# resolves to the patched copy (see run_openclaw_topk_select_modelfactory.sh's
# PATCHED_COMBINE_DIR handling -- must be wired in alongside the existing
# PATCHED_OPD_DIR/PATCHED_COMBINE_SELECT_DIR, both in the launcher's
# PYTHONPATH line AND in every train_*.sh caller that sets these env vars).
